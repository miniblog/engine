## Installation

- No database required.  Articles are written in Markdown with a sprinkling of JSON; pop those files in the content directory in your project and you're done.
- Requires only tech that's readily available in basic hosting packages.
- Installation is quick, with very little configuration&mdash;take a look at the [installation instructions](installation.md) to see what we mean.

## Website

- Google Lighthouse gives it scores of 100 across the board on both desktop and mobile when using HTTPS.
- It's fast.
- Uncluttered and easy to read.  The focus will always be the content.
- Mobile friendly.
- Automatic dark mode if the user's operating system says so.
- Semantic markup and appropriate microdata baked in.
- PHP code from qualified fenced code-blocks is automatically highlighted.
- User-friendly URLs.

## General

- Arranged to allow you to easily version-control just your content.
- While the focus isn't on flexibility, templates can be overridden, which does give some control over the appearance of your website.
- Miniblog is written in object-oriented PHP and is unit-tested.  It was designed to be basic, but robust and extensible.
