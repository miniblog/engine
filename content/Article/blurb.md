Thank you for installing Miniblog.  Please [let us know if you had any difficulties](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/issues)&mdash;or, indeed, if it was a pleasant experience.

It's likely you've seen, and updated, the config (in `config.php`, at the root of the project), so now you probably want to start adding content to your new blog.

🛠️ If you're the sort of person who prefers to learn by fiddling with things, then I suggest starting your investigation in `content/`.

🤓 If you'd like to get the lay of the land first, take a look at the [documentation on Miniblog content](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/blob/main/doc/content.md).

The most up-to-date documentation starts with the [Miniblog readme on GitHub](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/blob/main/README.md).  If you have any questions or feedback, [please get in touch](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/issues).

Have fun...
