Miniblog is an experiment in minimal website software design.  The aim is to create a blogging system that provides only the features that are really needed, only those that bring real value.  This is a process: only through continued use and development will that feature-set be realised.

Several needs must be balanced:
- The software should help its owner maintain focus on the task in hand; in this case, the task is publishing articles
- The website should be helpful to the end user, which means it should be easy to use and be easily consumed by search engines
- The software should use only the resources it absolutely needs to&mdash;every computation costs electricity
