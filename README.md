# Miniblog

Miniblog is a minimal blogging system written in PHP.  It is derived from [Dead Simple Blog (DSB)](https://github.com/paintedsky/dead-simple-blog) but since it is in conflict with some of [paintedsky's](https://github.com/paintedsky) original requirements, it is now a separate project.  Miniblog is, however, backwards-compatible with DSB and continues to carry the torch for minimalism.

If you're ready to get stuck in then [read the installation guide](doc/installation.md).  Otherwise, [the documentation starts here](doc/README.md).
