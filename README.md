Miniblog is a minimal blogging platform, written in PHP, aimed primarily at developers.

There is no complicated setup, no distracting admin area, and no plugins or themes: the focus is blogging.  Take a look at the [feature list](doc/features.md) and read [*Miniblog Guiding Principles*](https://justathought.dev/blog/miniblog-guiding-principles)&mdash;better still, all the articles on Miniblog's background&mdash;to get a feel for what we're about.
