Miniblog is a minimal blogging platform, written in object-oriented PHP, aimed primarily at developers.  There is no complicated setup, no distracting admin area, and no plugins or themes: the focus is blogging.  Take a look at the [feature list](doc/features.md) and the [Miniblog Guiding Principles](https://justathought.dev/blog/miniblog-guiding-principles) to get a feel for what we're about.
