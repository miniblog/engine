  - [ ] Display the three most recent articles on the homepage.
  - [ ] Create 'archive' page with pagination.  Update main menu.

- [ ] Support author URLs in config(?)  GitHub/GitLab, Twitter.  What else?
- [ ] Redesign.
  - [ ] Add some colour.
  - [ ] Move everything that isn't about the content, out of the way.  Make it more like an e-reader.
  - [ ] Use the Miniblog stamp instead of a textual platform message(?)
  - [ ] Put the platform message, and Website Carbon Badge, out of the way.  "Pop the hood" somehow, maybe.

- [ ] Map user-friendly URLs to HTML pages in the public directory(?)
- [ ] Map user-friendly URLs to templates(?)
