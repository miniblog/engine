- [ ] Support author URLs in config(?)  GitHub/GitLab, Twitter.  What else?
- [ ] Redesign.
  - [ ] Add some colour.
  - [ ] Move everything that isn't about the content out of the way.  Make it more like an e-reader.
  - [ ] Put the platform message, and Website Carbon Badge, out of the way.  "Pop the hood" somehow, maybe.

- [ ] Encode published date in the structure of the content filesystem.  Like `yyyy/mm/dd/post-name.md`.
- [ ] Map user-friendly URLs to HTML pages in the public directory(?)
- [ ] Map user-friendly URLs to templates(?)
