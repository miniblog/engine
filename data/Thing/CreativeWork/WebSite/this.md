Thank you for installing Miniblog.  Please [let us know if you had any difficulties](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/issues)&mdash;or, indeed, if it was a pleasant experience.

Now that you have Miniblog up and running, your next step is to [begin customising the website](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/blob/main/doc/installation.md#Basic-Customisation).

Remember: the most up-to-date documentation will always start with the [Miniblog readme](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/blob/main/README.md), and if you have any questions or feedback, [please get in touch](https://github.com/miniblog/engine/issues).

Have fun ðŸ™‚
